            <h2>Role Overview</h2>
            <!-- <p>During my time at Gap Inc., I worked as a Software Engineer and Data Analyst, focusing on developing robust financial solutions and improving operational efficiency within the Oracle Financial Cloud ecosystem.</p> -->
            <p>At Gap Inc., I worked as an Oracle Record to Report (R2R) Software Engineer in the Finance team, where I managed complex financial data using SQL, Oracle BI Tools, and Excel Macros/VBA. I was responsible for handling client requests related to discrepancies in financial data, identifying issues, and implementing solutions to ensure the accuracy and reliability of financial reporting.</p>
            <p>In addition to data management, I led the development of an Automated Journal Notification System. As the Product Manager, I acted as a bridge between senior developers and major stakeholders to address a $10 million journal backlog risk. I successfully executed the MVP within three months, which significantly improved the efficiency of journal approval processes and reduced operational bottlenecks.</p>                
            <p> I also worked closely with the product manager and the Kafka team to develop a microservices-based solution for Tax Code assignment related to Gap articles. This involved building a consumer and service API, which enhanced the scalability and flexibility of the system, streamlining tax code assignments across the organization.</p>
                Overall, my role at Gap Inc. involved managing large datasets, resolving data discrepancies, leading cross-functional projects, and delivering impactful solutions that optimized financial operations.</p>
